# Linear and Logistic Regression Implementation - Feedback

## 👍 What's Working Well 
- **Simple, readable pipeline**: Your code is straightforward and easy to follow. 
- **Performance reporting**: You've evaluated MAE and R², and shared sample predictions.

## 🤔 Areas to Improve 

### 1. **Feature Scaling / Standardization** 
Your continuous predictors for linearreg (`area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`) remain on different scales.   
Your continuous predictors logisticalreg (`age`, `fare`) remain on different scales.   

**Why it matters**   
- Unscaled features can slow down convergence and skew coefficient magnitudes.   
- Standardization (`mean=0`, `std=1`) often reduces MAE and boosts R². 

**Recommendation**   
```python 
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 
# e.g. wrap continuos features in a StandardScaler 
```

### 2. **Train/Test Split Ratio** 
You used `test_size=0.9`, leaving only ~10% for training for linear regression.
You used `test_size=0.7`, leaving only ~30% for training for logistic regression.

**Why it's suboptimal** 
- The model has very little data to learn from, harming coefficient estimates. 
- Results on a tiny training set aren't representative. 

**Recommendation** 
- Use an 80/20 or 70/30 split to balance learning vs. evaluation. 
- Consider cross-validation (e.g. K-fold) for more robust validation. 

### 3. **Regularization & Model Variants** 
A plain Linear Regression can overfit or underfit depending on feature correlations. 
Your logistic regression model is overfitted to the data, an accuracy of 100% means it's less robust to real data.

**Recommendation** 
- Try Ridge or Lasso to penalize large coefficients. 
- Compare performance with and without regularization. 

### 4. **Feature Engineering** 
Your current model uses only the raw inputs. 

**Recommendation** 
- Polynomial terms (e.g. area²) to capture non-linear effects. 
- Interaction features (e.g. bedrooms * bathrooms). 
- Label-encoding is for features that have ordinality, consider one-hot encoding to avoid implying an order.

## 📊 Expected Improvements

After implementing these suggestions, you should see:
- **Better model performance** (lower MAE, higher R²)
- **More stable predictions** across different data splits
- **Improved generalization** to unseen data
- **Better understanding** of feature importance and relationships
