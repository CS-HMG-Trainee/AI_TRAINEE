Hi Mahmoud,

I've reviewed your notebook and I'm impressed with your work. Here's my feedback:

### What I Liked:

- **Excellent Problem-Solving:** I was particularly impressed with how you handled the Hugging Face API issue. Instead of getting stuck, you quickly pivoted to a local model. This shows great initiative and a knack for problem-solving.
- **Clear and Organized Notebook:** The structure of your notebook is very clear. The markdown cells and headings make it easy to follow your thought process.
- **Thorough Data Exploration:** It's great that you started with a solid EDA. Understanding the data is a critical first step, and you've done it well.
- **Clean Code:** Your code is well-written and easy to read. Using functions for repetitive tasks like formatting the prompt and running the model is a good practice.

### Areas for Growth:

- **API Key Management:** In the future, it's a good practice to avoid leaving API keys, even empty ones, directly in the code. A better approach is to use environment variables or a configuration file. This is a small thing, but it's a key habit for writing secure and maintainable code.
- **Robust Error Handling:** When the API call failed, you correctly identified the problem. To make your code even more robust, you could add specific `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors and provide more informative messages.
- **File Path Management:** Try to avoid hardcoding file paths. Using relative paths will make your code more portable and easier for others to run.
- **Improving Summary Quality:** The summaries from `flan-t5-small` were a good start. As a next step, I encourage you to experiment with larger models or different prompting techniques to see if you can generate even more insightful summaries.

### Overall:

This is a great piece of work. You've demonstrated a strong understanding of the concepts and a great ability to work through challenges. I'm very pleased with your progress. Let's connect soon to discuss these points and your next steps.

Best,

Abdul Wajid
