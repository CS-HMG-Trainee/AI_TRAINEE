# Feedback for Reema Alhenaki

## Overall Assessment

Reema has demonstrated a strong understanding of the project goals and has effectively implemented a data processing pipeline that includes data splitting, cleaning, summarization, and a RAG implementation. The code is well-structured, and the notebooks are organized logically.

## Detailed Feedback

### Notebook 1: `1- split_big_file.ipynb`

- **Strengths:**
  - The notebook effectively splits the large CSV file into four separate files, which is a crucial first step.
  - The use of `polars` is a good choice for handling large datasets efficiently.
  - The function to clean duplicated columns is a good example of writing reusable code.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - The file paths are hardcoded. It would be better to use relative paths or a configuration file to make the code more portable. (Make use of .env file)

### Notebook 2: `2- clean_and_remove_nulls.ipynb`

- **Strengths:**
  - This notebook does a good job of cleaning the data, including handling null values and correcting data types.
  - The function to clean emergency contact information is well-written and handles several edge cases.
  - The use of `pandas_profiling` (as seen in the import) is a good practice for initial data exploration.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Similar to the first notebook, the file paths are hardcoded.

### Notebook 3: `3- generate_summaries_usingGEMNINAPI.ipynb`

- **Strengths:**
  - This notebook successfully uses the Gemini API to generate patient summaries.
  - The code includes error handling and retry logic, which is essential when working with APIs.
  - The ability to generate summaries for all patients or a single patient is a good feature.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - The API key is hardcoded in the notebook. This is a security risk. The API key should be stored in a separate, ignored file (e.g., a `.env` file) and loaded at runtime.
  - The prompt engineering could be further improved to handle cases where the data is incomplete or inconsistent.

### Notebook 4: `4- patient_rag.ipynb`

- **Strengths:**
  - This notebook implements a RAG system, which is a key requirement of the project.
  - The use of `sentence-transformers` and `faiss` is appropriate for this task.
  - The RAG pipeline is well-defined, with clear steps for embedding, indexing, and querying.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - The notebook uses the raw data for the RAG system, not the generated summaries. The next notebook addresses this, which is good.
  - The prompt could be more robust in handling different types of questions.

### Notebook 5: `4- patient_using_rag_summary_data.ipynb`

- **Strengths:**
  - This notebook improves upon the previous one by using the generated summaries in the RAG system. This is a significant step forward.
  - The chunking strategy is more sophisticated, splitting the summary into paragraphs.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - The output of the RAG system is not always accurate. For example, when asked for the patient's name, it returns a list of names and numbers. This indicates that the prompt or the model is not behaving as expected. Further prompt engineering and potentially fine-tuning the model could improve the results.

## Summary

Reema has done excellent work on this project. The data processing pipeline is well-designed and implemented. The use of the Gemini API and the RAG implementation are particularly impressive. The main areas for improvement are in code portability (hardcoded paths) and the accuracy of the RAG system.

I would recommend that Reema focuses on the following next steps:

1.  Refactor the code to use relative paths or a configuration file.
2.  Move the API key to a `.env` file.
3.  Experiment with different prompts and models to improve the accuracy of the RAG system.
4.  Try Gemini API to get better results.
